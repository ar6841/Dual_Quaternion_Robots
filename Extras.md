You can skip this section, it's just an introduction to help you visualize the problem at hand.

Let's build from the ground up to the idea of dual quaternions and what they represent intuitively. I think a good place to start is to think about how we represent points, lines, planes and 3D space.

### Lines planes and 3D space

Suppose for a moment that you're tasked with creating all of space in a universe of your own..kind of an impossible task for us measly humans but hey let's just give it a try, and use our imagination. One of the first things you're going to need is an origin, that's where it all starts right? So you start with the 0th dimension, a point we'll call this the origin $O$. Great but now you're stuck where you are, if you wanted to represent a direction you could have create another point $P$ and move towards it, as the creator of this universe you ONLY know about these two points, there's one and only one path you know about that you can take from your origin $O$ to your new point $P$, this is a line. You could also go in the reverse direction as you can move from $P$ to $O$ as well. Congratulations! You can now represent any real number $\mathbb{R}$, and a direction.
